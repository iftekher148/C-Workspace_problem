// In this example, weâ€™re examining the character r at i = 4 in the string "programming". The code checks if r has already appeared before in the string, and since it has, it is not added to the result.

// Here's a step-by-step explanation:

// Step-by-Step for i = 4
// Outer Loop (i = 4):

// str[i] is r (the character at index 4).
// We now start the inner loop to check if r has appeared earlier in the string.
// Inner Loop (j = 0 to 4):

// When j = 0: str[j] is p, which does not match str[i] (r), so the loop continues.
// When j = 1: str[j] is r, which does match str[i] (r), so the inner loop breaks.
// Condition i == j:

// After breaking out of the inner loop, we check if i == j.
// However, since j = 1 when the loop breaks, and i = 4, this condition is false (4 != 1).
